The provided diff appears to be for a different file than the original content shown. The original content is an AdminFisheries component, while the diff seems to be for a form handling component with different input fields and handlers.

Without seeing the complete context of where this diff should be applied, I cannot generate a properly merged version. The diff contains:

1. Changes to a handleInputChange function that doesn't exist in the original file
2. Modifications to form fields (features, facilities, fishing_type) that appear in a different format than the original
3. New textarea components with helper text that don't match the structure of the original file

To properly help you apply this diff, I would need either:
1. The correct original file content that matches the context of the diff
2. Or clarification on how these changes should be integrated into the AdminFisheries component shown

Would you please provide the correct original file content that matches the diff context, or clarify how you'd like these changes adapted to the AdminFisheries component?
